# ðŸ§  ML Model Comparator

An interactive and educational web app to **learn, compare, and predict** using machine learning models:

- ðŸ”µ Linear Regression  
- ðŸŒ² Random Forest  
- ðŸ”´ Logistic Regression  

Built with **React (Frontend)** and **Flask (Backend)**, this app lets you explore ML theory, run live predictions with custom inputs, and compare models through graphs and results.

## ðŸ“š Models Included

### ðŸ”µ Linear Regression
- Predicts continuous values (e.g., prices)
- Formula: `Y = b0 + b1X`
- Used for: Trends, forecasts

### ðŸŒ² Random Forest
- Uses many decision trees
- Works for both regression and classification
- Great for real-world messy data

### ðŸ”´ Logistic Regression
- Used for binary classification (yes/no, 0/1)
- Uses **sigmoid function**: `1 / (1 + e^-z)`
- Output is a probability
