add therotical of both linear and random forest in that show how to learn both model also add video link to learning both linear and random forest
show practical Comparium prediction 
prediction on eris dataset

show comparium between linear regression and forest in one page and comparium between random forest and logistic regression another page 
dark theme and light theme





add theory of both linear and random forest in that show how to learn both model also add video link to learning both linear and random forest
show practical comparision prediction 
prediction on iris dataset

also add an option for user input based prediction

show comparision between linear regression and forest in one page and comparium between random forest and logistic regression another page 

redesign the UI as well

Im using React + js so dont give me in tsx also make sure it is integrated with backend as well

i want to create new project using react(use only jsx or js dont use tsx) for frontend and flask for backend(api) that project contain

Design a clean, modern UI in React (JavaScript, no TypeScript) with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion animation for a full-stack ML web app. The app should include the following pages:

1. Home / Theory Page:
- Title: "Understanding Machine Learning Models"
- Sections for: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Logistic Regression
- Each section should include: 
    - a short, clear explanation
    - a placeholder for an embedded YouTube video
- Use animated cards or accordions for each model section
- Responsive layout with grid/flex
- Soft shadows, rounded corners, hover effects

2. Prediction Page:
- A form with input fields for: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width
- On submit, show predicted class using Linear Regression and Random Forest
- Display predictions in animated result cards or a comparison table
- Include a bar chart placeholder comparing predictions
- Use Framer Motion for smooth form and result transitions

3. Comparison Page: Linear Regression vs Random Forest
- Side-by-side comparison cards with metrics like Accuracy, MSE, R²
- Area for visual plots (placeholder divs)
- Theoretical differences in a table
- Smooth fade-in animations for charts and cards

4. Comparison Page: Random Forest vs Logistic Regression
- Same layout as above
- Include Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, Accuracy
- Bar and Pie chart placeholders

5. Navbar:
- Logo or App name on the left
- Links: Home, Predict, Compare LR vs RF, Compare RF vs Logistic

6. Footer:
- Light background, copyright
- Link to GitHub and About section

Use a modern, aesthetic layout with animations and transitions using Framer Motion. Use clean typography, ample padding, and responsive design.

Input X contains NaN. LinearRegression does not accept missing values encoded as NaN natively. For supervised learning, you might want to consider sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingClassifier and Regressor which accept missing values encoded as NaNs natively. Alternatively, it is possible to preprocess the data, for instance by using an imputer transformer in a pipeline or drop samples with missing values. See https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/impute.html You can find a list of all estimators that handle NaN values at the following page: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/impute.html#estimators-that-handle-nan-values
